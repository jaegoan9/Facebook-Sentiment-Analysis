So I don't reach out to other people very much.  I spend a lot of time alone.  But then I still get mad when I look on Snapchat and see people hanging out without me.

So if you have a place to go this Christmas, please consider sharing your good fortune.  As always, matches are approved by guests and hosts before anyone is connected.  So there are no surprises.

"As we hope for moderation, we must prepare for the possibility that rhetoric will become reality. It is not 'alarmist' to take a man at his word. We must recognize that a proven tactic for holding onto power is to deflect and channel anger onto populations with little political clout. History has proven this over and over again, to devastating results. One of our most vulnerable groups right now is the refugee population that the US has received from Iraq and Syria. Our President-elect repeatedly compared them to ""snakes"" on the campaign trail. We've learned their stories on this blog. These are innocent people who have experienced horrible trauma. They do not have a vote or a voice. So we must speak for them-- in our living rooms, our classrooms, and our courts. You may remember International Refugee Assistance Project, the nonprofit that helps organize lawyers to defend refugees. They have spent hundreds of hours helping us with Aya's case. (Wish I had good news to report there. I don't. Though we are still trying.) Yesterday I received an emotional phone call from Aya's lawyer. Her voice was shaking. She is terrified that the refugee population will be targeted in the coming months, and she asked if there was any way that we could help.

I thought that I was going to fall apart in front of my kids.  I ended up walking to the bookstore alone.  I was looking for anything that might help calm me down.  And I ended up grabbing The Power of Now.  It's not an easy thing to describe in words, but that book taught me how to stay in the moment.  It taught me to step back and observe my thoughts, to label them as 'thoughts,' and to create a gap between myself and the 'voice in my head.'  Once I realized that I am separate from my thoughts, it took away their power.  This photo was taken an hour before the surgery.  I'm with my grandson.  And there isn't a fear in my mind.

I wasn't sure how well I'd do.  And while we're waiting for the exam to start, a group of men began to yell things like: 'You don't need to be here.'  And 'There's plenty else you can do.'

It got very personal.  But I couldn't respond.  I couldn't afford to get distracted because I didn't want to mess up the test.  So I just kept looking down, hoping that the proctor would walk in the room.  I know that I can be perceived as aloof or cold or unemotional.   But I had to learn as a young woman to control my emotions.  And that's a hard path to walk.  Because you need to protect yourself, you need to keep steady, but at the same time you don't want to seem 'walled off.'  And sometimes I think I come across more in the 'walled off' arena.

Their spouse wants them to get a good job, and join the rotary, and save for a bigger house.  But it's only the veteran's body that has returned to safety.

"""The military is mostly filled with people who genuinely desire to do the right thing.  More Marines receive the Medal of Honor for jumping on grenades than any other action.  It's a culture where officers eat last and everyone shares their water.  These people grew up as boy scouts and girl scouts.  The whole reason they volunteered was because they wanted to do the right thing.  But the right thing is never clear in war.  If you shoot too early, an innocent person gets killed.  If you shoot too late, you lose a buddy.  So a lot of our injuries are moral ones.  Most of us come home feeling like we did something wrong.  Or we didn't give enough.

As with any group, there will be a wide range of viewpoints and experiences.  There are often conflicting feelings: patriotism, disillusionment, pride, regret, gratitude, and grief.  There is a common love for America, yet differing ideas about what exactly that means.  Many of these stories will include PTSD, but the hardships of returning veterans are far too nuanced for a single diagnosis.  And it can be inappropriate to use PTSD as a catch-all for those hardships.  So we've chosen to title the series 'Invisible Wounds.'

Every time he woke up, I'd just rock him back to sleep.  I never wanted him to be awake.  I was hoping so hard that he was still young enough to forget everything.  But the cancer kept coming back.

He brought all the families together and told them he needed two million dollars.  And they told him: 'We'll find it.'  We refer to them now as the Band of Parents.  These people were desperate.  Many of them were broke.  And this burden was being placed on them.  It made me sick.  But they went back to their communities.  They baked cookies, and organized bike rides, and held fundraisers named after their children.  And they raised the money.  All two million.  And it worked.  Dr. Cheung's antibody worked.

We're even planning on going to the beach. But the doctors tell us that they can't identify the tumor. The surgery was in July. August passes. September passes. Now that the tumor was gone, we were anxious to start treating the cancer, but nobody knows where to start. Every hospital is saying something different. Then finally two hospitals gave the same opinion: Descmoplastic Small Round Blue Cell Tumor. Nobody had ever seen this tumor in the brain before. They told me not to read about it. They told me that every case was different and not to read about it. When you read about it, it's very bad. Oh my God. This cancer always comes back. And when it comes back, it's worse. 'Less than three years,' it says. Oh my God. What did I do? What did I expose him to? What did I feed him? The chemo is so painful for him. My family tried to talk me out of it. They told me that I'm killing my son with my own hands. But what can I do? There's nothing I can do. I want to give blood. I want to give bone marrow. But all I can do is watch.

We told him that there was a black hole that was sucking all the good energy out of his brain. We told him that he was going to be cut a little bit, but we did not tell him how much. I told him that he may have difficulty speaking when he wakes up, but don't worry, because we're going to write to Mommy on a notepad. But I'm thinking inside that I'm never going to hear my son speak again. During the surgery, my husband and I just walked around aimlessly for hours and cried.

But I'm looking at Gabe and he's in a fetal position on the table. And I remember thinking that the way he was lying there, he looked like he did when he was born.

One day the teacher had him read out loud in class and he drooled all over the paper. So I raised a flag with the pediatrician. He thought it was just an allergy, but sent us to a neurologist just in case. The neurologist thought it was just a 'tick' and part of a growing phase. But he did an MRI just in case.

"Over the next couple of weeks, I'll be posting stories gathered from the Pediatrics Department of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  Obviously these are not going to be easy stories to read.  These are war stories.  The treatment of cancer can be nearly as violent as the condition itself, and even the doctors will frame their efforts in terms of warfare.  But the fight against pediatric cancer is uniquely tragic because the battlefield is the body of a child.  So these are definitely war stories.  But as with every war, there are heroes.  You'll meet the amazing doctors, nurses, and researchers who have committed their lives to this fight.  You'll meet the moms and dads who refuse to crumble while living out their greatest fear.  And most importantly, you'll meet the reason that everyone is fighting, and the greatest warriors of alläóîthe kids.  So yes, these are war stories.

"Susie passed away yesterday evening.  She came into my life quite unexpectedly five years ago.  I was photographing in Brooklyn one evening when I saw the coolest little dog sitting on a stoop.  I sat down to pet her, and after a few minutes, her owner told me that he was unable to care for her anymore.  He asked if I could take her.  I was broke at the time.  I was sleeping on a friend's couch.  And everyone that I asked told me that it was 'not the right time' for a dog.  But I was so charmed by Susie, and the whole encounter seemed so fated, that I offered to take her.It was one of the best decisions I ever made.  Susie was twelve years old at the time and didn't need much.  I'd never had a dog before.  It was a new experience.  I was introduced for the first time to a dog's unexplainable and unconditional love.  After a few weeks, it seemed that Susie's only concern in life was staying as close to me as possible.  There was now a joyous reunion waiting for me at the end of every workday.  And I learned that there are few greater blessings than a wildly happy dog greeting you at the door. Over the last few years, my fiancí© Erin developed her own relationship with Susie.  As many of you know, Erin started a nonprofit called Susie's Senior Dogs, which seeks to place older dogs in loving homes.  Older dogs have the hardest time getting adopted.  Because there is such a demand for young dogs, so many senior dogs are either euthanized or forced to spend the remainder of their lives in a shelter.  Over the past few years, Susie's Senior Dogs has placed several hundred senior dogs into homes.  There is a warm and active community of people who follow the page.  In fact, I think that half the people who come to my book signings are more excited to meet Erin than me.  So it's been a tough few days, but Erin and I are both very thankful that Susie came into our lives.  She was such a special friend.  She was my introduction to the love of dogs.  And she helped Erin discover her purpose in life.  So in a way she's going to stick around forever.  I encourage everyone to follow Susie's Senior Dogs, and consider allowing an older dog to change your life as well.",4/23/16 9:52,497886,16466,29135,374204,65184,111,53,58292,37

"Many of you have been asking for an update on Aya.  I'd been purposefully silent on her case in order to let the process run its course.  But now that three months have passed, I feel that all of you who followed Aya's story deserve an update.  We filed her appeal in early January.  A very encouraging development occurred almost immediately when The Department of Homeland Security agreed to remove Aya's missing father from the case.  Aya's lawyers were quite happy with this because they believed it simplified matters quite a bit.  They are now only appealing on behalf of Aya, her ill mother, and her three young siblings.  For obvious reasons, Aya's lawyers are confident that it should be very difficult to classify any of them as security threats.The frustrating part of the process is that it is completely obscure.  No feedback, updates, or timelines are given.  All of Aya's 'in-the-know' advocates have told me that they'd have expected a decision by now in her case.  So we continue to wait.  Adding to the frustration, we are unable to consider other resettlement options while the US sits on her case.   Until there is movement, Aya is essentially frozen in a very insecure limbo.  Considering the circumstances, she is doing OK.  She's very stressed right now because her mother is ill, and the responsibility for her family's security lies entirely on her shoulders.  We are supporting her the best we can from 5,000 miles away.  We're trying to make her situation as comfortable as possible using the money that we raised in December, supplemented by a generous and quiet donation from the GoFundMe company.Unfortunately there is not much more to report.  Over the last few months, Aya has attracted so many wonderful advisers and legal professionals to her cause.  She has high-placed supporters in some of the world's most influential humanitarian organizations.  Everyone involved is hoping that we will have a more substantial update soon.",4/6/16 16:54,80808,1021,608,72349,3322,62,9,4952,114
"""I've had serious problems with authority my entire life.  The first person I tried to piss off was my mother.  I got an Ivy League education and then became a street cop for six years.  I'd always been a knee jerk liberal.  I was one of those kids screaming 'off the pigs' at protest marches.  And then I ended up joining the force.  I think it should be mandatory for everyone.  We all have to take turns being the hall monitor in elementary school.  I think everyone should have to be a cop.  It's the ultimate social work.  It's the cop who has to step in when everything else has broken down.  It's where the rubber meets the road.  It's where conflict bubbles to the point of needing resolution, and somebody has to step in and protect the group welfare.  Ninety percent of the job is family disputes.  It's walking into a room and keeping people from killing each other.  Yet everyone hates cops.  Everyone loves the fire department, and everyone hates cops.  That's why I think everyone should have to do it.  Everyone should have to make an arrest. Everyone should have to feel the fear of trying to apprehend someone who doesn't want to go to jail.  Everyone should experience the 'fight or flight' response when flight isn't an option.  It breaks my heart to see all the hate toward cops.  Are there hateful, racist cops?  Sure.  And they should be punished.  But I've worked in just about every industry.  And I didn't find any more racism in the police department than I've found in boardrooms and retail stores.  Before I joined the force, I used to think that all cops were The Man.  Now I know that the cops are all of us.  Just a bunch of human beings trying to figure out how to play the game.

I've watched you retweet racist lies.  I've watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy.  I've watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to 'pay the legal fees' of those who commit violence on your behalf.  I've watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists' families.   I've watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood.

For the last few years, I've been working sixty to eighty hours a week.  I led a sales team of thirty people.  But my company got acquired and three weeks ago I got laid off.

"""I don't enjoy observing people as much as I used to.  Everyone acts like they're on stage.  People used to come to The Village sheepishly.  Nobody was sure if they belonged.  We didn't know if we were artists.  These days everyone walks around like they're contributing something.  There's no angst anymore.  There's too much certainty.  And that's a shame.  Because all the best art comes from people who feel like they don't belong.  Art is a way of proving your existence.  When I was a young man, a person that I respected told me that I was an artist.  It was one of the worst things that could have happened to me.  I stopped walking into museums or galleries with a sense of awe.  I walked in feeling like an 'artist.'  My arms would be crossed.  If I liked a piece, it was 'good.'  If I didn't like a piece, it was 'bad.'  I didn't feel vulnerable anymore.  I lost my humility.  And that's when growth stops.""",3/10/16 14:45,353998,7869,72435,333910,17252,2534,32,247,13

Next I'll become an assistant engineer, and I'll actually get to sit in on the recording sessions.  The ultimate goal is to become a producer.  Audio is a bit of a boys' club.  There were only three girls in my program at college, and there's only one other woman at my studio now.  I'm not sure why more women don't pursue it.  It's perfect for me.

I'd been raised on the idea that the man was supposed to provide.  But eventually I came around to the idea that money wasn't the only way to provide.  I could support her by doing chores, or taking the kids to school, or picking her up from the airport.  Her work benefited all of us, so I could help provide by making her job easier.

I thought everyone wanted peace, and a better environment, and that nobody hated anyone.  Then Nixon got elected using his Southern Strategy.  He tapped into so much hatred and racism.
